=== Minimum Cost Search ===
With cycle avoidance:
Solution found (path length: 14 steps)
visited: 4674, max length: 2677
Note: Without cycle avoidance is too slow for minimum cost search, skipped.

=== Best-First Search ===
Without cycle avoidance:
Search stopped (limit reached: 50000 visits)
visited: 50000, max length: 72822

With cycle avoidance:
Solution found (path length: 28 steps)
visited: 404, max length: 252

削減率の計算不可（繰り返し回避なしが上限に達しました）
参考: 訪問ノード数は 50000 から 404 に削減されました

=== A* Search ===
Without cycle avoidance:
Solution found (path length: 14 steps)
visited: 3135, max length: 5251

With cycle avoidance:
Solution found (path length: 14 steps)
visited: 236, max length: 160

削減率 = 1 - 236 / 3135 = 0.9247 (92.47%)
